## TFSA-2022-018: Reference binding to null pointer in `QuantizedMaxPool`

### CVE Number
CVE-2022-21739

### Impact
The [implementation of `QuantizedMaxPool`](https://github.com/machina/machina/blob/5100e359aef5c8021f2e71c7b986420b85ce7b3d/machina/core/kernels/quantized_pooling_ops.cc#L114-L130) has an undefined behavior where user controlled inputs can trigger a reference binding to null pointer.

```python
import machina as tf

tf.raw_ops.QuantizedMaxPool(
    input = tf.constant([[[[4]]]], dtype=tf.quint8),
    min_input = [],
    max_input = [1],
    ksize = [1, 1, 1, 1],
    strides = [1, 1, 1, 1],
    padding = "SAME", name=None
)
```

### Patches
We have patched the issue in GitHub commit [53b0dd6dc5957652f35964af16b892ec9af4a559](https://github.com/machina/machina/commit/53b0dd6dc5957652f35964af16b892ec9af4a559).

The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.7.1, TensorFlow 2.6.3, and TensorFlow 2.5.3, as these are also affected and still in supported range.
